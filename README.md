|**file**|**contents**|
|------|------|
|`data_gatherer.ipynb`|a script to extract the hashtag "Tea Party" data from the Tweets table and return it in csv format (Python)|
|`data_description.ipynb`|a script to run the Desriptive Statistics portion of the Final Assignment (Python)|
|`data_manipulator.ipynb`|a script to extract the data in the final fromat for analysis (Python)|
|`analysis.ipynb`|the analysis script using linear regression to answer the question (R)|

### Running the scripts

NOTE: All of the files must be run in a jupyter hub shell.

To run the sql query, run the file `data_gatherer.ipynb`. This will output multiple csv files that will be used for the analysis.

To find out some descriptive statistics about the Tea Party data corpus, run the file `data_description.ipynb`. This script runs through some questions and answers those questions throughout the script.

Running the `analysis.ipynb` script will run the linear regression analyses. Ensure that this file remains in the same directory as the `data` directory as it pulls from data generated by `data_manipulator.ipynb`. Output graphs are in the `graph` directory from this analysis.
